This project is a music streaming web application with full user authentication (registration, login, and logout) and a functional Home page where users can browse tracks using search, sorting, and filtering. Users can play any track from any track list page, and playback continues smoothly while navigating between pages and playlist selections. The app supports liking and unliking tracks both from the track list and directly inside the audio player, and includes a “My Playlist” section for favorite tracks. It also provides a complete audio player experience with play/pause controls, volume adjustment, repeat mode, shuffle mode, manual previous/next switching, and automatic playback of the next track when the current one ends. Token refresh is implemented to maintain user sessions securely.

Note: The original API URL used for user registration and for storing/fetching tracks is no longer supported. However, the application logic and API integration are fully implemented—the project only requires updating the API base URL to connect to a working backend.
